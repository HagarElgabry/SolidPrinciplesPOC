**SOLID** is one of the most popular sets of design principles in object-oriented software development. Itâ€™s a mnemonic acronym for the following five design principles:

Single Responsibility Principle
Open/Closed Principle
Liskov Substitution Principle
Interface Segregation Principle
Dependency Inversion
All of them are broadly used and worth knowing. But in this first post of my series about the SOLID principles,
I will focus on the first one: the Single Responsibility Principle.

**The Single Responsibility Principle**
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

**Open-Closed Principle**
The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

**Liskov Substitution Principle**
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

**Interface Segregation Principle**
Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.

**Dependency Inversion Principle**
The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.
